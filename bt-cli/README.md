# Simple command-line torrent downloader

This module contains a simple CLI launcher for **Bt**.

**NOTE #1**: Currently, all peer connections are established via [encryption negotation protocol](http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Message_Stream_Encryption) (also called MSE handshake). Therefore, in order to be able to connect to peers you must install [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html). The reason for this requirement is that the [MSE RC4 cipher](http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Message_Stream_Encryption) uses 160 bit keys, while default Java installation allows at most 128 bit keys.

**NOTE #2**: Currently, the CLI launcher can only work in headless mode under _Windows_. This mode is activated, if `-H` command line argument is present. GUI will be disabled, but you'll still be able to find out what's going on by inspecting the logs in current working directory.

## Usage

### Available options

```
$ java -jar target/bt-launcher.jar

-S, --sequential       Download sequentially                           
* -d, --dir <File>     Target download location                        
-e, --encrypted        Enforce encryption for all connections          
-f, --file <File>      Torrent metainfo file                           
-i, --iface            Use specific network interface                  
-m, --magnet           Magnet URI                                      
-p, --port <Integer>   Listen on specific port for incoming connections
-s, --seed             Continue to seed when download is complete      
--trace                Enable trace logging                            
-v, --verbose          Enable more verbose logging  
```

### Run

#### Using .torrent file
```
$ java -jar target/bt-launcher.jar -f /path/to/torrent -d /save/to/here
```

#### Using magnet link
```
$ java -jar target/bt-launcher.jar -m "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:AF0D9AA01A9AE123A73802CFA58CCAF355EB19F0" -d /save/to/here
```

#### Options

Add `-i <hostname>` or `-i <inetaddr>` to bind all connections to the specified address.

Add `-p <port>` to listen for incoming connections on the specified port.

Add `-e` flag to encrypt all peer connections.

Add `-S` flag to download the data in sequential order (e.g. for streaming content).

Add `-s` flag to continue seeding after torrent has been downloaded.

Add `-H` flag to run in headless mode, disabling the GUI.

Add `-v` flag to enable more verbose logging (especially useful in headless mode).

Add `--trace` flag to enable trace logging (loads of debugging information, useful to diagnose problems).

### Key bindings

`Press 'p' to pause/resume` _(GUI will "freeze" when paused)_

`Ctrl-C to quit`

### Shell wrapper

After you've run `mvn clean install -DskipTests`, all the main jars should be installed in your local Maven repository. Use the following shell wrapper to simplify launching the CLI client:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

java -jar /Users/atomashpolskiy/.m2/repository/com/github/atomashpolskiy/bt-cli/1.4-SNAPSHOT/bt-cli-1.4-SNAPSHOT.jar -m "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:$1" -d ~/Downloads
```

Save to this to a file, make it executable (`chmod +x <filename>` on Unix/Linux) and add the containing folder to `$PATH`. Then run:

```bash
$ myscript.sh AF0D9AA01A9AE123A73802CFA58CCAF355EB19F8
```
